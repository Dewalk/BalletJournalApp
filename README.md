This is my readme file for my Ballet Journal iOS App

The purpose of this app is for the ballet student to track their progress and have a place
to quickly and easily make notes after class. Keeping a journal is an extremely useful tool when learning a new skill or working to improve or level up in an existing skill.

This project was created in Xcode 8.2

It is a work in progress, so please be kind!
